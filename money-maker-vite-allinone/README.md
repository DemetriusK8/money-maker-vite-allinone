# Money Maker Vite Starter (All-in-one)

This project is a Vite + React + Tailwind starter pre-configured for fast deployment to Vercel.
It includes:
- Tailwind CSS
- AdSense-ready panel (insert your AdSense client & slot IDs)
- Auto-updating deals page (uses a public API placeholder)
- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI
- Build scripts for Vercel (use `npm run build`)

## Quick start
1. unzip the project
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run dev` to preview locally
4. commit to GitHub and import into Vercel (select Vite)

## Notes
- Replace `YOUR-ADSENSE-CLIENT-ID` in `src/components/AdSensePanel.jsx` with your actual value
- Replace the mock deals API with your affiliate provider/api
